## About Me

Hi, My name is Alexa Lopez! I'm a senior majoring in Information Technology and specialize in Web and Mobile foundations at Georgia Southern University. I admire working behind the scenes designing and customizing web pages and blogs. 

I'd love to be able to work with software developmnet,programming and/or maintenance for companies and grow with a team that will expose me to various working habits as well as technical skills. 

I've always liked to create and design, hence why I find programming to be really cool. I also love making social media pages look aesthetically pleasing and I use my own photography to enhance their appearance.  Please feel free to contact me if you need any further information!
